# Rank
This mod adds a ranking system to minetest.

## Documetation
This mod adds 2 commands and a privilege.

### Commands
  * You can set a player's rank with the /rank command.
    * Syntax: `/rank \<player\> \<rank\>`
  * You can rankup by normal means using the /rankup command.
    * Syntax: `/rankup`
    * To figure out the command, type it with an empty hand.

### Privileges
  * The *rank* privilege, if used in conjunction with the server privilege, will allow you to use the /rank command.

## Further Details
Using rank players will have a rank in their nametag so it will look like this: "[*rank*] *name*".
This mod is going to be made so that it works with the /nick command in my ![morecommands](https://github.com/bigfoot547/morecommands) mod.
